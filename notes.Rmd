## Testing Functions

-   informal testing in the console doesn't leave a record, so it becomes easy to break code that used to work
-   to get around this, do a **unit test**

**Unit Tests**
-   in R, use a package called "testthat"
-   testthat is supposed to make testing easy and "addictive"
-   describe what you want a function to do
Examples of unit tests build into testthat:
-   expect_equal() does the function return expected values?
-   expect_type() does the function return the expected type?
-   expect_length() if a vector is returned, is it the expected length?
-   expect_true() does the function return TRUE?

If the unit test passes, nothing will happen
If it **fails** then you'll get an error message
